The finance business manages a loan application process for our clients and as a part of our involvement in that process we need to advise clients what supporting documents are required according to their needs and the lender chosen. We then need to work with them until all documents are held to enable submission of the application in full to the lender. Initially the potential loan is shown as an opportunity, once that loan has been completed it then needs to transfer across to a product against that contact or company. We looking for an experienced CRM expert that is able to assist in customising the Zoho CRM to our business. We will also require some web developing tasks for the improvement of the website. Initially we require the following:1) Custom script developed that will create a product and assign it to a contact/company once the opportunity stage reaches won.2) Develop an app or customise a module (whatever is more effective) that will allow required supporting documents to be selected, and then an ongoing management of the outstanding documents (using automation) to ensure the clients provide all necessary documents. Document matrix will be able to be provided to determine the required documents as the data source for the app.3) Customer portal developed which incorporates management of the loan process, including the required documents mentioned in point 2, ideally allowing the client to upload direct into the portal (if that is possible). There will be other requirements for the portal also which will be discussed according to what is actually possible within Zoho. 4) Other web developing tasks to improve the website customer experience.We are seeking someone who is innovative and motivated to capture our initial ideas and then improve them according to their knowledge and experience in working with Zoho so we get the best result. Depending on the innovation, timeliness, capability and professionalism of the specialist selected to work to time and budget guidelines, there will likely be ongoing work as the business needs change and complexity of our needs and reliance on Zoho increases. This will likely also include software development separate to Zoho where our requirements are limited by any restraints that Zoho might have. In this case the software platform would need to be progressively built out and be designed from a user experience so that underlying function remains in Zoho –ie: buttons created within Zoho that link to the software and then push relevant data back into the Zoho CRM.
