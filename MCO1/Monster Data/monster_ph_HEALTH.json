Yet, 59% of the population and 72% of all households lack access to the internet. The Free Wi-Fi Internet Access in Public Places Project, otherwise known as Free Wi-Fi For All Program, was implemented starting June 2016. The Free Wi-Fi For All Program aims to provide free broadband Internet access to public places across the country.On August 2, 2017, Republic Act No. 10929, otherwise known as the Free Internet Access in Public Places Act of 2017, was enacted, which mandates the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) as the lead implementing agency that will oversee the effective and efficient implementation of said Act. Under the said law, the Free Public Internet Access Program was created that shall provide free access to internet service in public places throughout the country such as the national and local government offices; public basic education institutions; state universities and colleges, and TESDA technology institutions; public hospitals, health centers, and rural health units; public parks, plazas, libraries, and barangay reading centers; public airports and seaports; and public transport terminals.The provision of free internet access is targeted to accelerate the effective delivery of services, thus contributing to the attainment of sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly on quality education (SDG 4); gender equality (SDG 5); industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9); reduced inequalities (SDG 10); and, partnerships for the goals (SDG 17).To assist in accelerating the roll-out of the Free Wi-Fi For All, the DICT has engaged in a partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This phase of the DICT-UNDP partnership aims to expand internet access to up to 6,000 additional sites.Free Wi-Fi For All (FWFA) Project Outcome and OutputsThrough the project, it is expected that women and men from disadvantaged communities can enhance teaching/learning (improve their educational attainment), deepen their engagement in governance processes, and avail economic development opportunities through increased access to 6,000 Public Wi-Fi hotspots. In doing this, the project targeted beneficiaries from 2,400 public schools in 500 municipalities, of which 50% of the towns are 4th to 6th class, 90% have poverty incidences higher than the national average, and 35% are geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDAs).At the end of 2022, the project should have delivered the activities below through the following outputs:Output 1. Broadening people\u2019s access to free internet services in designated sites. The activities under this output will include research of appropriate technologies; assessment and market studies; procurement and partnership of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that offer the most feasible technology to project sites; and management of deployments and contracts of ISPs.Output 2. Organize and develop citizens capacity to use, monitor delivery, and install internet connections and performance of the free public internet service. This will involve the mapping of citizen organizations in project sites, provision of training to beneficiaries, use and enhancement of UNDP\u2019s existing mechanism for citizen\u2019s monitoring to measure the quality and reliability of the internet; and, documentation of the development impact.Output 3: Develop the capacity of DICT to contract and oversee the performance of internet service providers. This component will cover activities such as assessing DICT capacity; provision of a capacity building program to enhance DICT\u2019s Public Financial Management (PFM), Project Management, and Quality Assurance; and developing a sustainability plan.As part of the FWFA Output 2 above, the project partnered with Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) to mobilize and capacitate almost 10,000 project beneficiaries in selected four (4) provinces (Lanao del Sur, Batangas, Pampanga, and Abra) where free Wi-Fi sites are installed.Through the FWFA project, the UNDP shall engage a Consultant primarily to facilitate the project\u2019s major training workshops that will be participated by the UNDP FWFA team, DICT staff, and the partner NGOs.Duties and ResponsibilitiesObjective and Scope of WorkThe Consultant is also expected to produce a comprehensive training manual to be used by the NGOs in their capacity-building roll-out.
