A core component of Business Finance is the Product Control function. Product Control is a control function found in Financial Institutions, primarily in Investment Banks. Product Control is a crucial part of finance that provides transparent and accurate valuation and appropriate regulatory control to avoid reputational damage to the Bank. In Deutsche Bank, this control function leverages on a multi-skilled team with capabilities to understand the financial impact of trades from the analysis of Risks and Profit & Loss up to the substantiation of the Balance Sheets-- and creates a strong connectivity between the finance processes and the Front Office.The Risk and Profit & Loss team is responsible for producing daily profit-and-loss and risk numbers for the trading desks. It ensures all trading activities and figures are properly recorded and validated based on the Bank controls. Whereas, the Accounting Control core responsibility is to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the General Ledger for the transactions and products and provide full balance sheet substantiation for the product-specific accounts.We are looking for agile-minded, intellectually curious, self-driven individuals who can work in a fast-paced, ever changing environment to perform the following roles:Your key responsibilitiesPerform data completeness and integrity checks and/or review breaksProduce daily P&L and risk reports and analyze movements through review of risk profiles and market data changesAssist in the resolution of trader queries in a timely manner and obtain trader sign-off for final P&LLiaise with operations team to ensure breaks are cleared in a timely mannerYour skills and experienceBachelor's Degree in either Math, Finance, Economics, Accountancy, Business or Management Engineering, while further professional qualification or study .e.g. CPA, CFA, CMA, or Master\u2019s Degree will be an advantage.Knowledge of a range of financial products and markets will be expected from you in this role, while knowledge of US-GAAP/IAS is beneficial.Additionally, you will need to have strong competencies in investigation, problem resolution and detail intensivenessYou will also need to possess excellent communication skills and ability to confidently interact with a diverse set of stakeholders, as well as a change mindset- as Deutsche Bank embarks on a multi-year program to transform its strategic architecture and improve its processes.How we\u2019ll support youTraining and development to help you excel in your careerCoaching and support from experts in your teamA culture of continuous learning to aid progressionWhat we\u2019ll offer youCompetitive SalaryAttractive Retirement BenefitMedical and Life Insurance upon employment20 days Annual Vacation LeavesAbout us and our teamsis the leading German bank with strong European roots and a global network.
