While TaskUs is focused on employee wellness by having counselors on-site, resiliency programming, and other wellness initiatives, exposure to graphic and disturbing content is unavoidable. Some individuals with a sensitivity to viewing graphic or disturbing content may be at risk for developing distress, mental health symptoms, or, in rare instances, Secondary Traumatic Stress based on the content they are viewing.TaskUs reserves the right to reassign content moderators to other TaskUs projects based on staffing needs, employee performance, and other considerations.In order to help create a community that is safe for all employees, the Resiliency and Wellness Team takes an active role in the primary prevention of mental health concerns through direct practice efforts, e-learning, skills training, and outreach efforts to the TaskUs community.
