Joblum,"Implementations Project Executive | BGC, Taguig",IT - Hardware,TaskUs,2021-05-03,National Capital Reg,OJT,,Not Specified / In Description,Not Specified / In Description,"So, what does a TaskUs Project Executive really do? Think of yourself as one of the people managers AND people developers of your department, responsible for the success of your assigned Project Managers. Not just anyone is qualified for this role! We make sure we get the best of the best, after all, we are ridiculously good company so we make sure our employees are top-notch. Now we need your full concentration because it’s time to imagine what it’s like being an Implementations Project Executive. Imagine yourself going to work with one thing on your mind: managing and developing the current and future Implementations Project Managers of TaskUs. As Project Executive, you need to be in touch with reality, and the people you develop. You will design, implement, and maintain work evaluation processes. You coach your people and log in to your coaching sessions. You define career plans and training plans. You are responsible for the health and safety of your people as they deliver on their work. You carry out attaining the mission and the goals of the team and company. You are involved in developing and maintaining job descriptions and hiring your people. You create career plans and give advice on the career path. You evaluate their performance. You handle everyday questions about their work. You fire them (if necessary). You receive their resignation (if it happens). You actively seek out opportunities from lessons learned, and leapfrog across functions in order to get things fixed. You know your people’s expectations regarding their work content, their careers, work-life balance and how committed they are. You know your people’s priorities and what skills they need to perform best. You know what is needed for your people in order for them to succeed not just in their current job but for 2 jobs from now. You help them make 5 years + career plans. What else? Oh yeah. You’ll also need to maintain street-cred by being an Implementations Project Manager on occasion, wherein you will be responsible for owning the implementation process from start to finish. You will strive to provide an amazing experience for each and every client you work with, you will be held accountable for the overall success or failure of the launch, the internal team’s survey response of your performance, and the client’s NPS feedback of their overall implementation experience. You will perform deep-dive information-gathering sessions and collect client program requirements and you will validate the workflows and processes of incoming opportunities. You will manage client and project team expectations simultaneously for a frictionless onboarding experience, provide clients with guidance and process improvements throughout the implementation cycle, and act as an investigator and troubleshoot when process and operational discrepancies arise. You will handle day-to-day client communication throughout each implementation, host clients and ensure that client satisfaction and confidence in TaskUs remains high throughout the implementation. You will coordinate and work closely with internal departments. You will also adapt to the changing project priorities and complete deliverables on time with limited supervision in a fast-paced environment. Not to mention approaching all role responsibilities with great confidence, assertiveness and a sense of ownership. So. Do you have what it takes to become a TaskUs Implementations Project Executive? Requirements: This is what we are looking for. First off, we need someone who has the experience to even think of themselves as one. Definitely at least 5-years of experience in project management, and at least 2-years of experience in operations and/or account management role working directly with Client Points-of-Contact. Have a Bachelor’s degree? Experience in the BPO sphere? Great! Have something equivalent to these in life experience? That’s okay, too! Any international vendor management experience? Another plus! Someone with excellent written and oral communication skills. Has both strong problem-solving skills and excellent attention to detail, with a commitment to both accuracy and quality; experience in optimizing processes and increasing efficiency. Someone who has advanced knowledge of email ticketing and cloud-based systems (i.e. 8x8, Aircall, Five9, Salesforce, Zendesk) is a plus, but not required. Someone interested in how new technologies and businesses are changing the face of work. But most of all, someone who is willing to learn how we do things in TaskUs.Because TaskUs is not for everyone. About Us We are a collective of highly capable humans, who understand how to deploy technology and data to best serve your purpose. From Digital CX to Content Security, AI Operations, Consulting, and anything in between, we consider ourselves responsible for protecting our partners’ interests and supporting their long term success through innovation and technology -powered by ridiculously smart people.
