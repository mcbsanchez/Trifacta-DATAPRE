PROJECT OVERVIEW The STRIDE Program is a USAID/Philippines initiative that has a goal of strengthened science, technology, and innovation capacity for inclusive growth in the Philippines. It builds upon the shared vision with the Philippine Government’s 2017–2022 Philippine Development Plan in which self-sustaining, inclusive development can be achieved by “promoting science, technology, and creative arts to enhance innovation and creative capacity.” Consistent with USAID’s Journey to Self-Reliance framework, the program supports key Philippine institutions in the implementation of their own innovative solutions to achieve the country’s developmental goals. The goal of the STRIDE program is to stimulate inclusive economic growth by boosting science and technology research. One important aspect of doing research and its translation is an efficient and responsive supply chain of scientific materials to progress. This access to essential raw materials, equipment, supplies determines the ability of local researchers across academe and industry to develop new knowledge, products, and services that can benefit the society and aid in development goals. SCOPE OF WORK The initial results of the S&T procurement survey was initially presented to leaders of academia organizations. It is planned to further present the results to stakeholders and to gather feedback, verify the work, and proceed to qualify the results. Additional material would be created based on the results and feedback particularly guidelines. The generated material will be used to pursue advocacy in order to gain alliances and to publish the material in the general press. This effort is seen to raise the issue to appropriate stakeholders and create proposals for action. Generally, the policy consultant is in charge of the following tasks: Review of current context and relevant laws of RA 9184 or Public Government Procurement Reform Act and materials from STRIDE and other stakeholders Engage in dialogues and discussions with identified stakeholders to disseminate and increase awareness on operational difficulties affecting scientific supply chains in the Philippine setting across higher education and industry as evidenced by the survey Support the advocacy efforts with relevant stakeholders (e.g. HEI leaders, academic organizations, GPPB, COA) Lead the coordination and discussions with potential institutions/think-tank institutions that are interested to co-develop policy materials or documents Lead the development of policy materials (e.g. policy brief/note) with guidelines and recommendations for universities and industry to improve procurement efficiency in the academic R&D setting Co-write with interested stakeholders a publication in a peer-reviewed journal Regularly coordinate with STRIDE technical team assigned on R&D procurement including senior consultants to stratify activities and interventions KEY DELIVERABLES Convening stakeholders groups to discuss R&D procurement concerns and initiatives increase awareness on operational difficulties affecting scientific supply chains in the Philippine setting across higher education and industry Policy materials including recommendations for higher education institutions and regulatory agencies on R&D procurement Monthly Progress report (PPT/word file) REQUIRED SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS Bachelor's degree with at least 5 years of experience, or Master's degree with at least 3 years of experience, in the field of science, technology, and innovation and/or public policy Demonstrated ability and effectiveness to work collaboratively with higher education and government institutions in the Philippines An extensive understanding of the science, technology and innovation context in the Philippines Strong analytical and report writing skills Excellent communication skills PLACE OF PERFORMANCE The selected consultant shall perform a majority of the work at its own facility. Depending on the quarantine situation, the consultant may be required to meet at STRIDE office and stakeholders’ offices (which may require domestic travel).
